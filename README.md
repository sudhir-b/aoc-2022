# Advent of Code

This repository contains solutions for the Advent of Code challenges, implemented in Rust.

## Structure

Each day's solution is in its own directory, `day1`, `day2`, etc. Each directory is a separate Cargo project.

## Running the solutions

To run the solution for a specific day, navigate to the corresponding directory and use `cargo run`:

```bash
cd day1
cargo run
```
